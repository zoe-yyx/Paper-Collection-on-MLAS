## üîç Introduction

In the era of large language models (LLMs), autonomous LLM agents have transformed how tasks are executed. These agents interact with their environment and external tools, extending their capabilities to complete complex tasks efficiently and effectively.

As the next evolution, Multi-LLM-Agent Systems (MLAS) enable multiple LLM agents to collaborate within a unified ecosystem. By combining their strengths, MLAS offers several key advantages:
- Enhanced Problem-Solving: Synergistic collaboration among agents leads to improved performance.
- Flexibility and Scalability: Modular architectures adapt easily to changing requirements.
- Data Privacy: Participating entities retain control over proprietary data, fostering trust.
- Monetization Opportunities: Individual agents or systems can monetize their specialized contributions.

This repository compiles research papers and resources exploring the technical foundations, practical implementations, and business potential of MLAS. Dive in to explore the latest advancements in this exciting field! üöÄ
